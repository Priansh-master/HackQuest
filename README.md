<h2>Your Tasks for Hacktoberfest ‚úÖ</h2>
<p>For this Hacktoberfest, your contributions will focus on solving and adding competitive programming problems from various coding platforms (e.g., Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2 PRs for solving problems:</strong> Select problems from platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, or LeetCode, solve them, and submit your solutions. Make sure to add the solution in the appropriate folder.</li>
    <li><strong>1 PRs for adding new problems:</strong> Find or create unique competitive programming problems, and submit them under the relevant folder along with their solutions. The problems should be categorized based on their difficulty, corresponding to the rating ranges provided.</li>
    <li><strong>1 PRs for implementation of one of the codes:</strong> For the codes you have provided, you have to create an visual implementation of working of that code, and submit them under relevant folder. You can use any tech stack to create an visual working of your code on any given testcase.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> For each problem you solve or add, ensure that you follow the naming conventions and guidelines specified, including providing the problem link and a well-commented explanation of your solution.</p>


<h2>Contribution Guidelines üìù</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your solutions must be well-commented and clean.</li>
    <li>Problems added must not already exist in the repository, and should provide meaningful coding challenges.</li>
    <li>All PRs should include proper explanations or problem statements, including input/output formats.</li>
    <li>The PR description should include your Roll Number and Name at the top.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Solution Naming Convention:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Name your solution files using the format: <strong>Platform_ProblemName</strong>.</li>
            <li>Example: <strong>codeforces_8A</strong> for a problem from Codeforces or <strong>codechef_THREETOPICS</strong> for a problem from CodeChef.</li>
            <li>Example: <strong>newproblem_PROBLEMNAME</strong> for a newly created problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Problem Link and Explanation:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Each solution should contain a link to the problem on its respective platform (Codeforces, CodeChef, etc.).</li>
            <li>Provide a brief explanation of your approach in the solution file, outlining the logic, algorithm used, and why it works.</li>
            <li>Include comments for critical parts of the code to help others understand your thought process.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
